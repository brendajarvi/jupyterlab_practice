# jupyterlab_practice

This repo contains files related to practicing some more advaned features in JupyterLab. I practiced cell formatting, different cell types, practicing split view of jupyter notebook, exporting ipynb files to html using the code cell. It was very enjoyable to learn how to use LaTex to format mathematical equations (and very satisfying to run the code to see the formatted output).
